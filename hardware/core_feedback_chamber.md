# IX-Kirin Project  
## Core Feedback Chamber Specifications  

### Purpose  
The Core Feedback Chamber forms the central fourth object within the IX-Kirin Gankyil formation. It provides real-time energy condition monitoring, field stabilization, and pulse feedback control. This chamber receives synchronized pulse data from the surrounding tungsten toroidal cores and manages feedback loops essential for pulse regulation and system safety.
